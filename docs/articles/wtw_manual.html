<p>This manual was written for NCC-CNC GIS staff to provide explanations
for the basic functionalities of the <em>Where to Work</em> tool
(advanced version), to allow testing and recommendations for improvement
during the development phase. As such, it is subject to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="purpose-of-tool">Purpose of tool<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#purpose-of-tool"></a>
</h3>
<p>NCC is adopting a systematic and standardized approach to land
prioritization via the introduction of a spatial prioritization tool
<em>Where to Work</em> to NCC’s conservation planning framework. Doing
so enables NCC to establish quantitative, organization-wide conservation
goals and positions NCC to report on its collective impact in a way that
resonates with donors, partners and funders.</p>
<p><em>Where to Work</em> is a web-based, graphical user interface that
uses an algorithm to build and solve complex conservation planning
problems. The spatial prioritization tool that <em>Where to Work</em>
interfaces, or interacts, with is prioritzr, which uses integer linear
programming techniques to solve problems. The exact algorithms used are
guaranteed to find the optimal result <span class="citation">(Groves
&amp; Game, 2016; Hanson et al., 2023)</span> and can analyze large,
complex datasets efficiently, providing near real-time analysis for
stakeholder meetings and discussions <span class="citation">(Hanson et
al., 2023)</span>. However, it is important to note that what is optimal
mathematically may not be optimal from a practicality standpoint, and
the results are dependent on the input data. Thus, the tool is intended
for decision support, but is not meant to dictate final decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="software-dependencies">Software dependencies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#software-dependencies"></a>
</h3>
<p>The tool is available as an online web application. For the best
experience, it is recommended to use the latest version of the Google
Chrome web browser (<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" class="external-link uri">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a>). Efforts have been made
to support other web browsers, such as Mozzillla Firefox, Microsoft
Edge, and Apple Safari.</p>

<p>A commonly used decision-support framework that seeks to optimize
where to act and what to do in a systematic and repeatable way – two key
outputs of a conservation planning process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="spatial-prioritization-tool">Spatial prioritization tool<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-prioritization-tool"></a>
</h3>
<p>A problem-solving tool that uses an algorithm to inform the spatial
allocation of conservation actions (e.g., prioritzr, Marxan,
Zonation).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="theme">Theme<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#theme"></a>
</h3>
<p>Themes describe facets of biodiversity that are important for
conservation (e.g., species, habitats, ecosystems). To help safeguard
Themes, you can set Goals to ensure a minimum level of coverage by
solutions (e.g., setting a Goal of 20% ensures that 20% of the overall
spatial extent of the Theme is covered by the solution). Some Themes can
contain multiple components that are termed Features. For example, a
Theme pertaining to Threatened Species may contain Features, wherein
each Feature corresponds to a different species.</p>
<p>Note that “Goals” are similar to Marxan’s “targets”</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="weight">Weight<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weight"></a>
</h3>
<p>A Weight describes properties of places that can impede or improve
conservation efforts. Set the Weight factor between -100 and 100 to
indicate how important it is to avoid or cover (respectively) a given
Weight in the solution. To completely avoid a Weight (e.g., to avoid
areas with high human footprint), use a value of -100 (i.e. ensure that
planning units with the lowest possible values in the Weight dataset are
selected). To include as much of the Weight as possible (e.g., to
include areas climate refugia), use a value of 100 (i.e. ensure that
planning units with the highest possible values in the Weight dataset
are selected). Setting a value of zero (deselecting the Weight using the
toggle) means that it is not considered at all in the
prioritization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="includes">Includes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#includes"></a>
</h3>
<p>This term refers to areas that are already managed for conservation;
to build on the current reserve network, these areas should be
automatically included. However, solutions can be constructed that do
not automatically include the current reserves. These are also useful to
explore counterfactuals and management plans generated using other
processes (e.g., what if we built a new system from scratch?).</p>
<p>Note that “Includes” are similar to Marxan’s “locked-in” areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="excludes">Excludes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#excludes"></a>
</h3>
<p>This is the opposite of an Include. Areas defined as Excludes are
removed from the analysis and cannot be selected to contribute to Goals
(i.e. they are locked-out).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="planning-unit">Planning unit<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#planning-unit"></a>
</h3>
<p>A spatial locality (or area) that can be managed independently from
other localities. In many cases, planning units are defined using
property boundaries. In other cases, especially in large-scale planning
exercises, landscapes are often divided into equal-area (e.g., 1 km2)
grid cells that are used to serve as different planning units.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="reserve">Reserve<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reserve"></a>

<p>An optimization technique that aims maximize performance according to
certain criteria. Specifically, the <em>Where to Work</em> tool uses
exact algorithms implemented with the <a href="(https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc)" class="external-link">CBC</a> (Coin-or branch and cut)

<p>To begin, select the method for importing data into the application.
To use a previously prepared publicly available project, select
“built-in project.”</p>
<p>To upload a project dataset that was previously prepared for you
personally, select “upload project data.” This is the recommended
approach and is explained in detail in <a href="https://github.com/NCC-CNC/wtw-data-prep" class="external-link">wtw-data-prep</a>.</p>
<p>To upload a spatial dataset that has not been prepared specifically
for the tool, select “spatial dataset.” We don’t recommend this method
for reasons explained in <a href="https://github.com/NCC-CNC/wtw-data-prep/tree/main/shapefile_example" class="external-link">wtw-data-prep</a>.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="built-in-project">Built-in project<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#built-in-project"></a>
</h4>
<p>Sample projects are pre-loaded into the app. Select the project you
wish to view, then click “Import.” Several of these projects are sample
projects (e.g., those with the name “simulated”) and others have been
prepared by GIS technicians.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="upload-project-data">Upload project data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#upload-project-data"></a>
</h4>
<p>A project dataset comprises four files. These files include
configuration file, spatial data, attribute data, and boundary data
files. These files are created using custom R scripts or the ArcGIS
plugin currently under development. In most cases, a GIS technician
would prepare these files specifically for your project. Please note
that all four files need to be uploaded to the application.</p>
<p>Instructions and example scripts for creating these files can be
found in the <a href="https://github.com/NCC-CNC/wtw-data-prep" class="external-link">wtw-data-prep</a> github
repo.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="select-configuration-file">Select configuration file<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#select-configuration-file"></a>
</h5>
<p>A configuration file contains the specification for the project. It
specifies the Themes, Includes, Excludes and Weights that are part of
the project, along with default settings and colors for visualization.
This file is encoded using YAML (e.g, project.yml) file format (<a href="https://yaml.org/" class="external-link uri">https://yaml.org/</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="select-spatial-data">Select spatial data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#select-spatial-data"></a>
</h5>
<p>A spatial data file contains the geographic information used to
display the data on a map. Spatial data files can either be in the
GeoTIFF format (e.g., spatial_data.tif) or the ESRI Shapefile format.
Note that the ESRI Shapefile format is a file format that spans multiple
files with the same prefix and different file extensions. For example,
when uploading the “spatial_data” ESRI Shapefile, one must upload all
four of the following files: spatial_data.shp, spatial_data.prj,
spatial_data.shx, and spatial_data.dbf.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="select-attribute-data">Select attribute data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#select-attribute-data"></a>
</h5>
<p>An attribute data file details the expected amount of each Theme,
Weight, or Include within each planning unit. The attribute data files
can be supplied in the Comma Separated Values format (e.g.,
“attribute_data.csv”), or a compressed version of this format (e.g.,
“attribute_data.csv.gz”). Here, each column pertains to a different
Theme, Weight, Include or Exclude, and each row corresponds to a
different planning unit. The last column in this file should be called
“_index” and indicates the spatial index associated with each planning
unit (e.g., the index of the grid cell or geometry each planning unit is
associated with in the spatial data file).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="select-boundary-data">Select boundary data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#select-boundary-data"></a>
</h5>
<p>A boundary data file contains information on the spatial boundaries
of the planning unit. The boundary data file can be supplied in the
Comma Separated Values format (e.g., “boundary_data.csv”), or a
compressed version of this format (e.g., “boundary_data.csv.gz”).
Specifically, it can be provided using the Marxan boundary data file
format, wherein it contains the following three columns: “id1”, “id2”,
and “boundary”. The “id1” and “id2” columns indicate the shared boundary
between different planning units based on their spatial indices, and the
“boundary” column indicates the length of these shared boundaries (e.g.,
100m). To encode the length of boundaries along the outer edge of the
study area, the “id1” and “id2” columns can contain the same spatial
index value. This data is used when the spatial clustering options are
enabled (see below).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="spatial-dataset">Spatial dataset<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-dataset"></a>
</h4>
<p>An ESRI Shapefile can be uploaded to the application to automatically
create a new project. Please note that this approach is not generally
recommended for beginner users, because users need to ensure that the
spatial dataset contains all relevant Themes, Weights, Includes and
Excludes. Additionally, because the spatial dataset upload option
involves creating a new project, this means that none of the Themes,
Weights, or Includes/Excludes will have sensible default options (e.g.,
Goals or factors) and the provenance of the underlying data is unknown.
Note that the ESRI Shapefile format is a file format that spans multiple
files with the same prefix and different file extensions. For example,
when uploading the “spatial_data” ESRI Shapefile, one must upload all
four of the following files: spatial_data.shp, spatial_data.prj,
spatial_data.shx, and spatial_data.dbf.</p>

<p><img src="figures/sidebar3.png" width="2046"></p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="themes">Themes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#themes"></a>
</h4>
<p>Themes can be selected (enabled) so that they are used to generate
solutions (i.e., by clicking the toggle button next to each Theme). If a
Theme is enabled, then the slider can be used to specify a Goal for the
Theme. If a Theme contains multiple Features: the toggle buttons next to
each Feature can a be used to enable or disable them (individually), and
the sliders next to each Feature can also be used to specify the Goals
for each Features (individually). For convenience, the Goals for Themes
that contain multiple Features can be set simultaneously (under the
“group” tab) or separately (under the “single” tab).</p>
<p>Each Theme shows the overall amount that is currently Included (both
as a percentage and the units specified for the Theme, e.g., hectares),
and the overall amount that is specified by the Goal (both as a
percentage and the units specified for the Theme, e.g., hectares). For
example, setting a Goal of 30% for a Theme, means that each solution
will aim to cover 30% of the overall amount of the Theme.</p>
<p><img src="figures/sidebar4.png" width="2044"></p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="weights">Weights<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weights"></a>
</h4>
<p>Weights can be selected (enabled) so that they are used to generate
solutions (i.e., by clicking the toggle button next to each Weight). If
a Weight is enabled, then the slider can be used to specify a factor for
the Weight. Depending on the nature of the Weights, it may be important
to increase their coverage within solutions (by using a positive Weight
value), or important to decrease their coverage within solution (by
using a negative Weight value). If there are multiple Weights that
should be considered simultaneously when generating solutions, the
relative importance of different Weights can be specified by setting
factors that are increasingly or decreasingly further from zero. For
example, if we had two Weights, we could assign a factor of 20 to one
Weight to increase its coverage by the solution, and a factor of -80 to
the second Weight to decrease its coverage by the solution. Although the
tool will consider both criteria, there may be trade-offs (e.g., some
planning units might have high values for both Weights). In such cases,
because -80 is much further away from zero than 20, we are saying that
it is more important for solutions to decrease coverage of the second
Weight than it is to increase coverage of the first Weight.</p>

<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="total-area-budget">Total area budget<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#total-area-budget"></a>
</h5>
<p>The area budget specifies the maximum spatial extent for the solution
(as a percentage of the study area). This is the largest area that the
solution can prioritize. Critically, specifying a total area budget
means that the tool can generate prioritizations that do not meet the
Goals for all Themes. If the area budget setting is turned off, the
solution will always meet the Goals (or it will return an error pop-up
if this is not possible).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="spatial-clustering">Spatial clustering<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-clustering"></a>
</h5>
<p>The spatial clustering parameter controls how important it is for
solutions to select planning units that are sited next to each other.
This parameter is similar to the Boundary Length Modifier parameter in
Marxan <span class="citation">(Ball et al., 2009)</span>. Here, the
spatial clustering parameter is a percentage that describes how much
more costly (i.e. in terms of total area budget or selected Weights)
that the solution can be to reduce spatial fragmentation.</p>
