<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This article is intended for users already familiar with the basic
functionality of the <em>Where to Work</em> tool. It is recommended to
first read the <a href="wheretowork.html">official manual</a> before
proceeding.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to explore some of the underlying
algorithms and behavior of <em>Where to Work</em>, so that users can
better understand and interpret their results. This will also allow
users to develop more advanced workflows to fully utilize the power of
the tool for systematic conservation planning.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this article, we will briefly review the main
components of <em>Where to Work</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Planning units</strong>: the building blocks for <em>Where
to Work</em>, each planning unit has a value for all the conservation
Features (e.g. species) and Weights (e.g. human footprint) loaded into
the app.</li>
<li>
<strong>Goals</strong>: the amount of each conservation Theme or
Feature that needs to be captured in the solution (e.g. 20% of a species
range).</li>
<li>
<strong>Includes</strong>: any planning units that should be
locked-in to the solution.</li>
<li>
<strong>Excludes</strong>: any planning units that should be
locked-out of the solution.</li>
<li>
<strong>Area budget</strong>: an optional cap on the number of
planning units that can be used in a solution.</li>
<li>
<strong>Weights</strong>: secondary objectives whereby if two
solutions meet the same Goals, the solution satisfying the Weights
should be preferred.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can think of the combination of planning units, Goals, Weights,
Includes, Excludes and area budget as defining a specific <em>Where to
Work</em> scenario which we will refer to as a
<code>conservation problem</code>. The goal of <em>Where to Work</em> is
to solve the <code>conservation problem</code> by finding the optimal
combination of planning units that meet all the Goals while accounting
for any Weights, Includes and Excludes. If an area budget is defined,
then <em>Where to Work</em> attempts to find the best solution to the
<code>conservation problem</code> using the number of planning units it
has available based on the area budget.</p>
<p>The underlying software running the <em>Where to Work</em> algorithms
is an R package named <a href="https://prioritizr.net/index.html" class="external-link"><strong>prioritizr</strong></a>.
prioritizr is a powerful coding tool for finding the optimal solution
for complex <code>conservation problems</code>. <em>Where to Work</em>
can be thought of as one implementation of prioritizr, it provides some
of the most common prioritizr functionality in a user accessible online
application, but there are many more advanced features in prioritizr
that are not available in <em>Where to Work</em>.</p>
<p>We will provide links to the <a href="https://prioritizr.net/" class="external-link">prioritizr documentation</a> at various
points in this article for readers interested in learning more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="planning-units">Planning Units<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#planning-units"></a>
</h2>
<p>Planning units for <em>Where to Work</em> can either be square cells
of equal size (i.e. a raster layer), or a combination of polygons of any
shape and size (i.e. a shapefile). The data preparation for <em>Where to
Work</em> involves summarizing all of the Themes, Weights, Includes and
Excludes in each planning unit. More information on this can be found in
the <a href="wtw_data.html">Data</a> article and in the <a href="https://github.com/NCC-CNC/wtw-data-prep" class="external-link"><em>Where To Work</em>
data preparation repository</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="theme-goals">Theme Goals<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#theme-goals"></a>
</h2>
<p>Setting Theme Goals is the first step in a <em>Where to Work</em>
project. Goals are set as percentage (%) values that get translated into
a numeric Goal within <em>Where to Work</em>. <em>Where to Work</em>
will try and meet the Goal by ensuring that the planning unit values in
the solution exceed the numeric Goal. The numeric Goal for a Feature is
the calculated as:</p>
<p><code>Goal [numeric] = sum of all values in all planning units * (Goal [%] / 100)</code></p>
<p>Typically, Themes represent the spatial extent of a conservation
feature (e.g. a species), so the numeric Goal will be an area. <em>Where
to Work</em> doesn’t actually care what the units are though, it simply
calculates the numeric Goal based on the values in the planning
units.</p>
<p>This is important to know when preparing data and setting Goals. The
planning unit values need to be numeric so that they can be summed
together across planning units. It doesn’t make sense to have
categorical or ordinal data in <em>Where to Work</em> for example
because the values cannot be summed for Goal-setting. A land cover map
representing forested and grassland areas for example would need to be
separated out into two individual Themes where the planning unit values
represent the area of each land cover type within the planning unit. See
the <a href="wtw_data.html">Data</a> article for more detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="includesexcludes">Includes/Excludes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#includesexcludes"></a>
</h2>
<p>Includes and Excludes are simple to understand, they force-in or
block-out planning units from the final solution. They can be a powerful
way of customizing your <code>conservation problem</code>. See the <a href="#advancedworkflows">Advanced workflow</a> section of this article
and the <a href="https://ncc-cnc.github.io/wheretowork/articles/wtw_data.html">Data
article</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="area-budget">Area-budget<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#area-budget"></a>
</h2>
<p>An area budget can be applied in <em>Where to Work</em> which will
restrict the number of planning units available in a solution. This is
common in target based conservation planning where we often want find
the optimal area to protect if we can only conserve say 30% of the
landscape. We recommend always solving the
<code>conservation problem</code> first using no area budget. This will
give a baseline solution which can then be restricted by applying an
area budget (see the <a href="#workflow">Recommended workflow</a>
below).</p>
<p>An important point is that <code>conservation problems</code> with
and without an area-budget use different underlying algorithms to
generate a solution. <strong>If no are budget is used, the solution will
meet all Goals using the smallest</strong> <strong>area of planning
units possible.</strong> Once an area budget is applied that is less
than that required to meet all targets, <em>Where to Work</em> needs to
decide how best to meet the Goals it can using the planning units it has
available, recognizing that some Goals will not be met. These different
objectives are discussed more below.</p>
<p>For the purpose of demonstrating these concepts, we will set up a
simple example using some demo data.</p>
<p>We’ll have 6 species, each occupying either one or two of our nine
planning units. For simplicity, the Goal for each species will be 1
planning unit.</p>
<p><img src="figures/theory1.png" width="1152"></p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="no-area-budget">No area-budget<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#no-area-budget"></a>
</h4>
<p>If no area budget is set, then <em>Where to Work</em> runs an
algorithm that aims to meet all of the Goals using as little planning
unit area as possible. In our example, since our planning units all have
the same area, it will simply meet the Goals using the fewest number of
planning units.</p>
<p>In the prioritizr world, this algorithm is known as the <a href="https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_min_set_objective.html" class="external-link">min
set objective</a>. It uses a mathematical algorithm to identify the
‘minimum set’ of planning units that meet all the Goals.</p>
<p>In our example, the minimum set solution is the top row of planning
units. This is the only way to represent at least one planning unit of
each species using just three planning units.</p>
<p>The larger the Goals, and the more you have, the more planning units
will be needed to find the minimum set solution. This is worth thinking
about when setting your Goals. If you have a species that covers all
your planning units, and you set a Goal of 50%, your solution will
automatically need to cover at least 50% of the planning units.</p>
<p><img src="figures/theory2.png" width="1152"></p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="with-area-budget">With area-budget<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#with-area-budget"></a>
</h4>
<p>If an area budget is set in <em>Where to Work</em>, it limits the
number of planning units available in the solution. Since <em>Where to
Work</em> will not be able to meet all of the Goals, it has to decide
how to allocate the planning units to get the ‘best’ solution. There are
<a href="https://prioritizr.net/reference/objectives.html" class="external-link">different
ways to do this</a>, <em>Where to Work</em> uses a method that minimises
the total Goal shortfall (the prioritizr algorithm for this is called
the <a href="https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_min_shortfall_objective.html" class="external-link">min
shortfall objective</a>).</p>
<p>Shortfall is the proportion of each Goal that has not been met. Note
that using the proportion rather that the actual area standardizes
shortfall across all Goals, so it doesn’t matter how big the original
area Goal was, only the proportion missing counts. If a Goal is met then
its shortfall is zero. If a Goal has no representation in the solution,
then it’s shortfall is 1.</p>
<p>The algorithm sums all of the shortfalls while searching for a
solution, and the optimal solution will be the one that has the lowest
total shortfall value. In practice, this algorithm does a good job of
passing Goals while maintaining a balanced amount of the missing Goals.
In general, the missed Goals tend to be fairly evenly distributed
throughout the planning units of the final solution (i.e. the shortfalls
of missed Goals follow a normal distribution).</p>
<p>In our example, if we assign <em>Where to Work</em> a budget of two
planning units, the best solution that minimises overall shortfall is to
select two planning units from the top row. The best we can do with two
planning units is to fully meet three Goals, and fully miss two
goals.</p>
<p><img src="figures/theory3.png" width="1152"></p>
<p>The calculation of total shortfall for this solution is as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>total shortfall =
            species 1 shortfall +
            species 2 shortfall +
            species 3 shortfall +
            species 4 shortfall +
            species 5 shortfall +
            species 6 shortfall</code></pre>
<p>where the shortfall for a give species is calculated as:</p>
<pre><code>target missing / target</code></pre>
<p>For our solution, species 3 and 6 are the only ones not met, so total
shortfall is calculated as:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">0</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">0</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">0</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">0</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">/</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">2</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="workflow">Area-budget - recommended workflow<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#workflow"></a>
</h4>
<p>Solutions using area budgets can show strange patterns as the area
budget approaches and exceeds the minimum set area. The reason for this
is that the if the algorithm meets all the targets but still has some
area budget left, it doesn’t know what to do with it. It will start to
sequentially gather additional planning units to use up the area budget,
leading to strange patterns in the solutions. This is described in more
detail <a href="https://github.com/prioritizr/prioritizr/issues/205" class="external-link">in
this issue</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For this reason, it is important that the area budget never
exceeds the amount needed to meet all Goals.</strong></p>
<p>We therefore recommend the following workflow when using area
budgets:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Develop the conservation problem by setting Goals and deciding on
any Weights, Includes and Excludes.</li>
<li>Run the minimum set (no area budget) solution to find out how many
planning units are needed to meet all Goals. <em>Where to Work</em> will
report the total number and % of planning units in the solution.</li>
<li>Run the area budget solution(s), but do not exceed the values
reported in the minimum set solution. For example, if the minimum set
solution uses 50% of the planning units, do not exceed 50% as an
area-budget. Our testing suggests that keeping area budget 5-10% below
the min set % is good practice.</li>
<li>If the min set solution uses fewer planning units that the area
budget you are interested in, increase your Goals. For example, if you
want to test a 30% area budget for 30x30 planning, but your min set
solution only requires 25% of the planning units to meet all targets,
then you need to make your conservation problem more ambitious by
increasing the Goals.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="nestedness">Area-budget nestedness<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nestedness"></a>
</h4>
<p>While thinking about area budgets it’s worth discussing nestedness.
There is a general expectation that when using increasingly large area
budgets (e.g. 10%, 20%, 30% etc.) that solutions from lower area budgets
will be nested inside the solutions of larger area budgets. For example,
we might expect the 10% solution to be contained within the 20% solution
and so on.</p>
<p>The thinking here is that the 10% solution must be capturing the
best, most important planning units on the landscape, and so we’d expect
those to also be included in the higher area budget solutions.</p>
<p>This is not always the case, for the important reason that the
prioritizr algorithm does not rank planning units based on how important
they are, rather for a given conservation problem it returns the optimal
solution based on that problems parameters. When the area budget
changes, so does the conservation problem, and since the objective is to
find the most efficient solution that satisfies the conservation
problem, there is no guarantee that solutions will be nested.</p>
<p>This is actually an intended feature of prioritizr and it means that
<em>Where to Work</em> allows us to solve much more complex and tailored
scenarios. Instead of ranking all planning units based on a simple
metric such as species richness, and then selecting the top 10%, 20%,
30% etc. (which would be nested), we are able to set individual Goals
for hundreds of Features and find the optimal combination of planning
units to meet those Goals. All the planning units in the solution
contribute to meeting the Goals, and if we want to know which planning
units contribute to the most Goals, we can do subsequent analyses to
investigate this (e.g. <a href="https://prioritizr.net/reference/importance.html" class="external-link">prioritizr
importance scores</a>; <a href="https://github.com/NCC-CNC/impact" class="external-link">Resiliency Index tool</a>).</p>
<p>We can demonstrate this non-nested behavior with our example data.
When we calculate the optimal solution using area budgets of one, two
and three planning units, we see that the first solution is not nested
within the others. The reason for this is that with an area budget of
one, we’re trying to meet as many Goals as possible with a very limited
budget. This is a challenge and the best we can do is to meet three
Goals using the bottom left planning unit. As we increase the area
budget, we have more planning units to play with. We can actually find
better solutions by ignoring the bottom left planning unit and focusing
on other planning units where those species also occur (and overlap with
other species).</p>
<p><img src="figures/theory4.png" width="1152"></p>
<p>This is obviously a very simple example and in real world problems we
often have many thousands of planning units and large numbers of Goals.
In our testing, we have found that the non-nested behavior described
here is most apparent at low area budgets (e.g. 10% when the min set
requires 50%). As area budgets increase, the solutions should become
more nested and will converge towards the minimum set solution.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that some <code>conservation problems</code>
do produce nested solutions in <em>Where to Work</em>.It really depends
on the distributions of the Features and the Goals of a given
problem.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="weights">Weights<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weights"></a>
</h2>
<!-- **Update this section after completing [#329](https://github.com/NCC-CNC/wheretowork/issues/329)** -->
<p>Using Weights in <em>Where to Work</em> can be difficult because
there is no way to know exactly how a Weight will impact your solution.
All we know is that given multiple competing solutions, the one that
best satisfies the Weight requirements will tend to be selected.</p>
<p>It’s possible however that a selected Weight is incompatible with the
primary objective of meeting Goals. This can be confusing when you
select the Weight but it has no impact on the solution. To return to our
simple example, we might add a positive Weight to our
<code>conservation problem</code> that aims to weight solutions towards
areas known to have high connectivity. If the area of high connectivity
does not overlap with any of our species, the Weight will have no impact
on the selected solution. Since the Weight is a secondary objective, it
can only influence the solution if it overlaps with some planning units
that satisfy the Goals.</p>
<p><img src="figures/theory5.png" width="1152"></p>
<p>Given the different algorithms used for area-budget vs. no
area-budget problems in <em>Where to Work</em>, Weights have to be
applied differently in the underlying code. The outcome is the same:
solutions satisfying the Weights will be preferred. To fully understand
what <em>Where to Work</em> is doing we will review the two approaches
below (this gets more technical so feel free to skip this section).</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="weight-with-no-area-budget">Weight with no area budget<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weight-with-no-area-budget"></a>
</h4>
<p>In <em>Where to Work</em>, the ‘budget’ being used when gathering
planning units into a solution is the planning unit area (<strong>under
min set it currently defaults to 1 but we should change to
area</strong>). For the minimum set problem we are trying to meet the
Goals while minimizing area. In the prioritizr world, this is referred
to as the ‘cost’ of the planning unit. And in prioritizr, cost does not
have to be area, it can be the literal cost to acquire a planning unit,
or any other value assigned to planning units that governs how costly
they are to add to a solution.</p>
<p>When applying Weights under the minimum set problem in <em>Where to
Work</em>, we take advantage of this to change the cost of planning
units based on the selected Weights. If no Weights are selected, the
planning unit cost is simply the area of the planning unit
(<strong>currently defaults to 1</strong>). If Weights are selected, the
Weight layers are multiplied by the selected Weight factor (ranges from
-100 to 100), rescaled, and summed together (when using multiple
Weights). (<strong>see #329, need to explain that Weights should account
for PU area in data prep</strong>). The result is that planning units
with higher values of positive Weights are assigned lower costs and will
be preferred in solutions, and planning units with higher values for
negative Weights are assigned higher costs and will be avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="weight-with-area-budget">Weight with area-budget<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weight-with-area-budget"></a>
</h4>
<p>When using an area budget, the planning unit ‘cost’ has to be the
actual area of each planning unit. That way <em>Where to Work</em> knows
how much area budget it is using based on the planning units selected.
This means we cannot incorporate the Weights into the planning unit
costs as we did for the minimum set problem.</p>
<p>Instead, the Weights are added as additional Goals to the
conservation problem. The Goal is calculated as the Weight factor
(converted to a proportion) multiplied by the sum of the Weights values
across all planning units. When finding a solution, <em>Where to
Work</em> will try and meet the Weight Goals just like any other Goal,
so the final solution should prefer planning units that contain a larger
amount of the Weight (<strong>note that weights are not currently
clipped to Themes, see #323</strong>).</p>
<p>Note that under both area-budget and non-area-budget scenarios,
<em>Where to Work</em> will report the area of each Weight in the
results summary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="optimality-gap">Optimality gap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#optimality-gap"></a>
</h2>
<p>When solving conservation problems, prioritizr has a parameter called
the <strong>optimality gap</strong> which determines how close the
returned solution needs to be to the optimal solution. If the optimality
gap is set to 0%, the single best optimal solution will be returned.
This comes with a time penalty since solving to optimality takes a
certain amount of time depending on the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p>Where to Work sets the optimality gap to 10% for the minimum set
problem and 50% when using an area budget. This allows for much faster
processing and means that the returned solutions will be within 10% or
50% deviance of the optimal solution. The downside is that two <em>Where
to Work</em> runs using the same inputs could return different
solutions.</p>
<p>If a user runs the exact same conservation problem twice in the same
<em>Where to Work</em> session, it will cache the solution and simply
return the same solution to save time on the second run. If a user runs
the exact same <code>conservation problem</code> twice in different
<em>Where to Work</em> sessions (i.e. by closing the app in between),
it’s possible that slightly different solutions will be returned due to
optimality gap. The deviance between solutions is usually quite small,
and is mostly noticeable when the problem is relatively simple and has
many equally good solutions that meet the Goals (maybe because there are
a small number of Goals, or Goals are easy to meet). As problems get
more complex by adding more Goals, higher Goals, and adding Includes and
Excludes, the effect of the optimality gap decreases and in most cases
that we have tested, the same solution is returned across different
sessions.</p>

<p>Includes allow the user to force a set of planning units into the
solution. This is typically used for including existing protected areas
in the solution since they are already providing protection and
therefore represent a logical starting point for building out a
prioritization.</p>
<p>Includes can however represent any important feature that a user
wants to lock in to a solution. This could be certain planning units
that represent critical habitat that should be the starting point of a
solution (note that in the case of Features, using an Include is the
same as setting a Goal to 100%), or they could represent areas that have
important cultural values that are central to the planning objective and
not merely Goals.</p>

<p>Users can take Includes a step further by linking multiple solutions
together. In particular, by taking the output of one conservation
problem and using it as an Include for the next. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-021-01528-7" class="external-link">This paper</a>
provides an example of this to force solutions at different area budgets
to be nested within each other. The approach involves running an
area-budget solution at say 10%, then providing that solution as an
Includes in a 20% area-budget solution and so on. This forces the 10%
solution to be the starting point for the 20% problem and ensures all
lower area-budget solutions are nested within higher area-budget
solutions.</p>
<p>We do not necessarily recommend this for a typical prioritization
(due to the reasons highlighted in the <a href="#nestedness">nestedness</a> section above), but we include it here
as an example of how <em>Where to Work</em> is flexible to user needs
and creativity.</p>

<p>More information on the mechanics of <em>Where to Work</em> can be
found in the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>A good place to practice and get familiar with some of these
advanced concepts is by using some of the simple built-in projects in
<em>Where to Work</em>.</li>

this has much more detail on the underlying math behind the algorithms.
The <a href="https://prioritizr.net/articles/publication_record.html" class="external-link">publication
record</a> also has many examples of these concepts being applied in
conservation scenarios.</li>
