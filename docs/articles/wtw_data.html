<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This article is intended for users already familiar with the basic
functionality of <em>Where to Work</em>. It is recommended to first read
the <a href="wheretowork.html">official manual</a> before
proceeding.</p>
<p>Input data for <em>Where to Work</em> needs to be summarized by
planning unit during the data-prep stage. We strongly recommend using
the 4-file input format described in <a href="https://github.com/NCC-CNC/wtw-data-prep" class="external-link"><em>Where To Work</em>
data preparation repository</a>.</p>
<p>As described in the Goals section of the <a href="wtw_theory.html#theme-goals">Theory</a> article, <em>Where to
Work</em> operates on the values assigned to each planning unit.
Planning unit values for Themes, Weights, Includes and Excludes
therefore need to be carefully prepared before feeding the planning
units into <em>Where to Work</em>. The correct way to summarize the
input data depends on the planning unit type (i.e. equal area vs
different areas), the units of the input data (i.e. area/distance/count,
other units, unitless), and the type of layer being summarized
(i.e. Theme, Weight or Include/Exclude). Planning unit values can
generally be of two types: binary, where all the values are either zero
or one; or continuous, where any value is possible. Generally we
recommend that all Includes and Excludes use binary values, and all
Themes and Weights use continuous values. This is explained further
below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="themes">Themes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#themes"></a>
</h2>
<p>The important thing to remember for Themes is that each Theme will be
assigned a Goal, and <em>Where to Work</em> will attempt to meet the
Goal by summing the Themes values across all planning units in a
solution. As such, values need to be numeric and have meaningful units
(e.g., km, km<sup>2</sup>, tonnes of carbon). Additionally, we would
ideally retain as much detail from the source data as possible when we
summarize the data for the planning units.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="areadistancecount-data">Area/distance/count data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#areadistancecount-data"></a>
</h5>
<p>Most Themes will be layers representing area, distance or count data.
Examples are species ranges (area), lengths of rivers (distance), and
points representing important sites (count). We recommend simply summing
the area/distance/count of these data in each planning unit.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/species_range.png" alt="*Fig 1. Species ranges representing areas of presence/absence are converted into planning unit values representing the area of each planning unit covered by the species range.*" width="2068"><p class="caption">
<em>Fig 1. Species ranges representing areas of presence/absence are
converted into planning unit values representing the area of each
planning unit covered by the species range.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>In the case of species range data, we could set a threshold
(e.g. 50%) and assign each planning unit to presence/absence based on
the overlap with the planning unit and the threshold (i.e. every
planning unit would have a value of either zero, or the full planning
unit area). This approach creates clean maps that look nicer in the
<em>Where to Work</em> display. However, summing the area retains more
information, especially in cases where some range polygons are smaller
than the planning units.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="categorical-data">Categorical data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#categorical-data"></a>
</h5>
<p>Categorical data need pre-processing for the <em>Where to Work</em>
tool. These data includes rasters or vector data that contain integer
values that correspond to different classes. For example, land cover
data are often expressed as categorical data, where each land cover
class (e.g., forest, shrubland, grassland) is stored as a different
integer value. To use such data with the <em>Where to Work</em> tool, we
recommend extracting each categorical class as a separate Theme that
contains binary values (i.e., zeros and ones) indicating if the class is
present within each planning unit. This process is also known as <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-one-hot-encoding/" class="external-link">one hot
coding</a>. For example, you might have a categorical land cover dataset
that contains forest, shrubland, and grassland classes. In this dataset,
a value of 1 might denote forest areas, a value of 2 might denote
shrubland areas, and a value of 3 might denote grassland areas. To
prepare such data, we recommend converting this dataset into a three
separate Themes (one Theme for each class) that each contain binary
values (i.e., zeros and one) indicating where a given land cover class
is present. Thus the first Theme would contain binary values indicating
the presence or absence of forest areas, the second Theme would contain
binary values indicating the presence or absence of shrubland areas, and
the third Theme would contain binary values indicating the presence or
absence of grassland areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="probability-data">Probability data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#probability-data"></a>
</h4>
<p>Probability data benefits from pre-processing to ensure that the
<em>Where to Work</em> tool provides meaningful solutions. For example,
probability data may include predictions by species distribution models.
Although it is possible to use such probability data with the <em>Where
to Work</em> tool, this can produce undesirable results. In particular,
when using such data as Themes, it is possible to generate solutions
that meet the Goal for the Theme by selecting lots of planning units
with low probability values. This can be undesirable because you may
wish to, instead, obtain a solution that selects fewer planning units
with higher probability values. In such cases, we recommend selecting a
threshold to convert the probability values into binary values and using
the binary data as a Theme for the <em>Where to Work</em> tool. Thus the
only way for a solution to meet the Goal would be to select planning
units that have a probability value above the selected threshold. If you
wish to retain some continuous information, another strategy is to clamp
the probability values such that (i) values below a selected threshold
are set to zero and (ii) values above the threshold remain the same. As
such, a solution cannot meet the Goal by selecting planning units with
low probability values, and information on the relative occurrence can
be used to inform the optimization process.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="other-data">Other data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-data"></a>
</h5>
<p>Other data types will need to be considered on a case by case basis.
For example, a dataset describing carbon sequestration might describe
the amount of carbon (in tonnes) that could be potentially be
sequestered per pixel. In this case, the total amount of carbon per
planning unit could be calculated by summing together the pixel values
that occur within the planning unit. Remember that <em>Where to
Work</em> will run using any input layer values, so the responsibility
is on the user to make sure the values provided are suitable.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/carbon.png" alt="*Fig 2. A raster layer representing tonnes of Carbon can be summed into the planning units and can retain the same units.*" width="2088"><p class="caption">
<em>Fig 2. A raster layer representing tonnes of Carbon can be summed
into the planning units and can retain the same units.</em>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="weights">Weights<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weights"></a>
</h2>
<p>Ideally, data-prep for Weights should follow the same guidelines as
Themes, however since Weights do not have Goals attached to them there
is some additional flexibility. Unitless Weights can be used for
example, as long as the values are numeric.</p>
<p>If planning units are all the same size, it may be appropriate to
calculate the mean Weight value per planning unit. However, where
possible we still recommend summing values, especially if planning units
are of different sizes. This is because <em>Where to Work</em> does not
account for planning unit area when processing Weights. If a larger
planning unit should have a relatively higher Weight than a smaller one,
this should be accounted for during data prep (e.g. by summing rather
than averaging).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/connectivity.png" alt="*Fig 3. Connectivity is a unitless Weight. Here we calculate the average connectivity value per planning unit, but if planning units were of different sizes we might consider summing.*" width="2074"><p class="caption">
<em>Fig 3. Connectivity is a unitless Weight. Here we calculate the
average connectivity value per planning unit, but if planning units were

</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="includesexcludes">Includes/Excludes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#includesexcludes"></a>
</h2>
<p>The guidelines for Includes and Excludes are different because every
planning unit needs to be either locked-in or locked-out of the
solution. Values should therefore be binary where each planning unit has
a value of zero or one. This means that for source data representing
areas, users will need to decide thresholds to determine if planning
units are assigned as zero or one depending on the overlap of the
planning unit with the source layer. Using a 50% threshold for areas is
generally recommended because it should average out to cover
approximately the same area as the input data. In some cases users might
want to use a different approach. For example an Include could be set to
one if any of the planning unit intersects with the source layer.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/includes.png" alt="*Fig 4. For includes of existing protected areas, we use an area threshold of 50% so any planning unit with &gt;= 50% coverage is assigned a value of 1, otherwise it's assigned a value of 0.*" width="2053"><p class="caption">
