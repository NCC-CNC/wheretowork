<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This article is intended for users already familiar with the basic
functionality of the Where to Work tool. It is recommended to first read
the <a href="https://ncc-cnc.github.io/wheretowork/articles/articles/wtw_manual.html" class="external-link">official
manual</a> before proceeding.</p>
<p>Input data for Where to Work needs to be summarized by planning unit
during the data-prep stage. We strongly recommend using the 4-file input
format described in <a href="https://github.com/NCC-CNC/wtw-data-prep" class="external-link">wtw-data-prep</a> with
raster planning units, or shapefile planning units if planning units of
different shapes and sizes are required.</p>
<p>As described in the Goals section of the <a href="https://ncc-cnc.github.io/wheretowork/articles/articles/wtw_theory.html#goals" class="external-link">wtw-theory</a>
article, Where to Work operates on the values assigned to each planning
unit. Planning unit values for Themes, Weights, Includes and Excludes
therefore need to be carefully prepared before feeding the planning
units into Where to Work.</p>
<p>The correct way to summarize the input data depends on the planning
unit type (i.e. equal area vs different areas), the units of the input
data (i.e. area/distance/count, other units, unitless), and the type of
layer being summarized (i.e. Theme, Weight or Include/Exclude).</p>
<p>Planning unit values can generally be of two types: binary, where all
the values are either zero or one; or continuous, where any value is
possible. Generally we recommend that all Includes and Excludes use
binary values, and all Themes and Weights use continuous values. This is
explained further below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="themes">Themes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#themes"></a>
</h2>
<p>The important thing to remember for Themes is that each Theme will be
assigned a Goal, and Where to Work will attempt to meet the Goal by
summing the Themes values across all planning units in a solution.
Values therefore need to be numeric, have specific units (e.g. km, km2,
tonnes of carbon ect.), and ideally we would like to retain as much
detail from the source data as possible when we summarize the data into
the planning units.</p>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="areadistancecount">Area/distance/count<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#areadistancecount"></a>
</h5>
<p>Most Themes will be layers representing area, distance or count data.
Examples are species ranges (area), lengths of rivers (distance), and
points representing important sites (count). We recommend simply summing
the area/distance/count of these data in each planning unit.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/species_range.png" alt="*Fig 1. Species ranges representing areas of presence/absence are converted into plannnig unit values representing the area of each planning unit covered by the species range.*" width="2068"><p class="caption">
<em>Fig 1. Species ranges representing areas of presence/absence are
converted into plannnig unit values representing the area of each
planning unit covered by the species range.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>In the case of species range data, we could set a threshold
(e.g. 50%) and assign each planning unit to presence/absence based on
the overlap with the planning unit and the threshold (i.e. every
planning unit would have a value of either zero, or the full planning
unit area). This approach creates clean maps that look nicer in the
Where to Work display. However, summing the area retains more
information, especially in cases where some range polygons are smaller
than the planning units.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="other-units">Other units<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#other-units"></a>
</h5>
Other layers could have non-area/distance/count units that will need to
be considered on a layer-by-layer basis. A dataset detailing tonnes of
Carbon per pixel for example could be summed to calculate the tonnes of
Carbon per planning unit. Remember that Where to Work will run using any
input layer values, so the responsibility is on the user to make sure
the values provided are suitable.
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/carbon.png" alt="*Fig 2. A raster layer representing tonnes of Carbon can be summed into the planning units and can retain the same units.*" width="2088"><p class="caption">
<em>Fig 2. A raster layer representing tonnes of Carbon can be summed

</div>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="unitlessnon-numeric-values">Unitless/non-numeric values<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#unitlessnon-numeric-values"></a>
</h5>
<p>If users want to inlcude Themes from input data that do not have
units, or are categorical, it is usually best to convert the source data
into polygons and use the area approach described above. Here are some
common examples:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Categorical land cover data</strong> - extract each land
cover type as a separate Theme and calculate it’s area in each planning
unit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Species probability maps</strong> - these are not
recommended because they are unitless. Additionally, while Where to Work
would run using probability values, it can result in solutions that meet
the Goal by collecting lots of planning units with low probability
values which is this case represents low quality habitat. This is not
really what we want, it would be better to meet the target with higher
quality habitat only. The best approach is to choose a threshold and
convert the habitat probability into a binary map of high quality
habitat. This can then be treated as an area layer and the planning unit
values will represent the area of high quality habitat.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="weights">Weights<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weights"></a>
</h2>
<p>Ideally, data-prep for Weights should follow the same guidelines as
Themes, however since Weights do not have Goals attached to them there
is some additional flexibility. Unitless Weights can be used for
example, as long as the values are numeric.</p>
<p>If planning units are all the same size, it may be appropriate to
calculate the mean Weight value per planning unit. However, where
possible we still recommend summing values, especially if planning units
are of different sizes. This is because Where to Work does not account
for planning unit area when processing Weights. If a larger planning
unit should have a relatively higher Weight than a smaller one, this
should be accounted for during data prep (e.g. by summing rather than
averaging).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/connectivity.png" alt="*Fig 3. Connectivity is a unitless Weight. Here we calculate the average connectivity value per planning unit, but if planning units were of different sizes we might consider summing.*" width="2074"><p class="caption">
<em>Fig 3. Connectivity is a unitless Weight. Here we calculate the
average connectivity value per planning unit, but if planning units were

</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="includesexcludes">Includes/Excludes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#includesexcludes"></a>
</h2>
<p>The guidelines for Includes and Excludes are different because every
planning unit needs to be either locked-in or locked-out of the
solution. Values should therefore be binary where each planning unit has
a value of zero or one. This means that for source data representing
areas, users will need to decide thresholds to determine if planning
units are assigned as zero or one depending on the overlap of the
planning unit with the source layer. Using a 50% threshold for areas is
generally recommended because it should average out to cover
approximately the same area as the input data. In some cases users might
want to use a different approach. For example an Include could be set to
one if any of the planning unit intersects with the source layer.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figures/includes.png" alt="*For n includes of existing protected areas, we use an area threshold of 50% so any planning unit with &gt;= 50% coverage is assigned a 1, otherwise it's assigned a 0.*" width="2053"><p class="caption">
<em>For n includes of existing protected areas, we use an area threshold
of 50% so any planning unit with &gt;= 50% coverage is assigned a 1,
otherwise it’s assigned a 0.</em>
