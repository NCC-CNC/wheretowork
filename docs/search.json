Broadly speaking, exact algorithms can solve various types optimization problems. example, simplex algorithm can solve linear optimization problems contain continuous decision variables (termed “linear programming problems”). Additionally, branch bound algorithm can solve linear optimization problems contain integer decision variables (termed “integer programming problems”) contain integer continuous decision variables (termed “mixed integer programming problems”). algorithms applied many different tasks, facility location (Canel & Khumawala, 1996), job scheduling (Beaumont, 1997), route optimization (Schouwenaars et al., 2001). also becoming increasingly popular conservation planning (Hanson et al., 2019; .

Solving optimality can also reassure decision makers proposed solutions provide best possible outcomes, given data objectives entered system. Also, strict optimality required, can solve problems within pre-specified optimality gap (e.g., identify solution within 10% optimality). can useful solvers often able generate near optimal solutions much quickly strictly optimal solutions, whilst still providing guarantees solution quality. Although types algorithms can applied conservation problems (Ciarleglio et al., 2008; e.g., heuristic meta-heuristic algorithms; J. B. Kirkpatrick, 1983; S. Kirkpatrick et al., 1983; Nicholls & Margules, 1993), provide guarantees , , may require re-running optimization process tens thousands times verify solution quality (Ardron et al., 2010). Additionally, exact algorithm solvers can readily applied wide variety problems. Work tool uses exact algorithm solvers, can easily accommodate variety different conservation planning problems. instance, Work tool can used generate () prioritizations minimize cost whilst ensuring goals met (.e., “minimum set reserve selection problem”) (ii) prioritizations aim reach many goals possible, whilst ensuring total selected area exceed pre-specified budget (.e., “budget-limited reserve selection problem”). Furthermore, another advantage using exact algorithm solvers steadily increasing performance time (Achterberg & Wunderling, 2013). interfacing exact algorithm solvers, means Work tool leverages improvements newer versions solvers become available time. also several disadvantages using exact algorithm solvers. key disadvantage best performing exact algorithm solvers commercial software (e.g., Gurobi IBM CPLEX). Although open source exact algorithm solvers available (e.g., CBC, HiGHS, SYMPHONY), generally solve optimization problems quickly commercial solvers might able solve particularly large problems (Schuster et al., 2020). Commercial solvers often provide special free licenses academic use (e.g., Gurobi IBM CPLEX); however, commercial licenses may required use governmental, commercial, non-governmental organizations. , organizations may need carefully consider potential benefits costs associated using commercial solvers. Another disadvantage exact algorithms can much slower types algorithms. example, heuristic algorithms – guarantee solution quality – can generate near-optimal solutions optimization problems faster exact algorithms (Pressey et al., 1997; Zanakis & Evans, 1981). Indeed, Zonation decision support tool – powered iterative algorithms (Moilanen et al., 2022) – can likely solve budget-limited reserve selection problems faster Work tool. Finally, can challenging solve large-scale non-linear problems exact algorithms [e.g., problems include complex metrics connectivity; Keeley et al. (2021)]. Although means might able solve particularly complex mathematical optimization problems (Moilanen, 2008), exact algorithm solvers can applied many conservation planning problems (e.g., Hanson et al., 2019; . S. Rodrigues et al., 2000).","code":""},{"path":"https://ncc-cnc.github.io/wheretowork/articles/wtw_optimization.html","id":"explanation-of-how-an-exact-algorithm-works","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Explanation of how an exact algorithm works","title":"Optimization","text":"explain branch bound algorithm – one earliest exact algorithms – can used solve optimization problems (Land & Doig, 1960). main aim section explain possible algorithm guarantee optimality, without iterating every single possible solution. Since article intended audience strong mathematical background, provide basic understanding algorithm. ease interpretation, begin intuitive description. branch bound algorithm involves iteratively subdividing optimization problem hierarchical tree sub-problems. , base (stump) original optimization problem, branch different sub-problem, tips branches different solutions original problem. exploiting hierarchical structure tree, algorithm can effectively search optimal solution without examine every possible solution (.e., tip). Indeed, algorithm can examine particular branches determine optimal solution found tips connected branch. algorithm terminates explored enough tree identify optimal solution original problem. Hopefully, intuitive description useful. However, details required, provide thorough description . define terminology aid describing algorithm. objective value measure quantifies quality candidate solution (e.g., cost set prioritization, well prioritization safeguards variety species). Also, optimal solution solution best possible objective value particular problem, whilst meeting constraints (e.g., cost prioritization must particular budget threshold) variable restrictions (e.g., particular variables “purchase” “purchase” must integer binary) defined problem. Additionally, incumbent solution best solution found far course optimization process, sometimes initially estimated using heuristic algorithm. Finally, bound optimal solution best estimate objective value optimal solution. course optimization process, bound optimal solution become accurate. Also, note bound optimal solution mathematically defined equal , better , objective value optimal solution (e.g., maximization problem, greater objective value optimal solution). defining terms, can begin describing branch bound algorithm detail. branch bound algorithm starts solving relaxed version original optimization problem. particular, problem contains integer (binary) variables can relaxed create new problem substituting integer (binary) variables continuous variables. example, problem contained integer variable ranging 1 5, relaxed version problem contain new continuous variable ranging 1.0 5.0. Since problems contain continuous variables much easier solve, relaxed problem can solved relatively quickly. solution relaxed problem meets integer (binary) restrictions original problem, optimal solution original problem found. However, rarely case. solution relaxed problem likely contain non-integer (non-binary) values integer (binary) variables. , solution relaxed problem considered feasible (contains non-integer values “purchase” “purchase” variables must contain integer binary values), optimal solution original problem. However, mean solution useless. objective value solution relaxed problem always better (equal ) objective value optimal solution original solution, objective value solution relaxed problem can used set initial estimate bound optimal solution. see subsequent procedures, bound optimal solution updated refined course optimization process. solution relaxed problem can used subdivide relaxed problem series sub-problems. sub-problems can viewed hierarchically subordinate “children” “parent” problem. example, solution relaxed problem value 4.3 integer variable, variable used create two sub-problems () adding constraint specifying variable must <=4<= 4 (ii) adding constraint specifying variable must >=5>= 5. solution relaxed problem contains many values meet integer (binary) restrictions variables, might large number sub-problems. algorithm decide particular sub-problem explore . Indeed, methods used determine sub-problem explore enormous impact run time, fast exact algorithm solvers algorithms dedicated help speed process. algorithm solve chosen sub-problem. Although sub-problem one (potentially multiple) additional constraint(s), still relaxed version original problem can solved relatively quickly. Depending solution sub-problem, one three following procedures applied. First, () solution sub-problem contains values meet integer (binary) restrictions variables (ii) objective value solution better objective value incumbent solution, solution earmarked new incumbent solution. Second, () solution sub-problem contains values meet integer (binary) restrictions variables (ii) objective value solution provide better bound optimal solution, sub-problem abandoned another sub-problem selected chosen sub-problem. Third, () solution sub-problem contains values meet integer (binary) restrictions variables (ii) objective value solution provides better bound optimal solution, objective value solution used update bound optimal solution sub-problem subdivided sub-sub-problems. One sub-sub-problems selected new chosen sub-problem, procedures previously outlined paragraph applied, recursively, new chosen sub-problem. course optimization process, bound optimal solution objective value incumbent solution become similar . Indeed, sub-problems solved obtain better estimates bound optimal solution, bound optimal solution get closer objective value incumbent solution. Additionally, sub-problems solved obtain better quality feasible solutions, objective value incumbent solution improve. example, maximization problem, bound optimal solution typically start relatively high value (.e., reflecting overly high initial estimate optimal objective value) decrease sub-problems explored bound refined. Whereas, objective value incumbent solution start low value (.e., reflecting poor quality solution original optimization problem) increase solving sub-problems yields better quality feasible solutions. algorithm terminates bound optimal solution objective value incumbent solution similar values. particular, algorithm terminate relative difference expressed percentage (.e., optimality gap) bound optimal solution objective value incumbent solution meets pre-specified threshold. example, 0% optimality gap specified, algorithm terminates bound optimal solution objective value incumbent solution equal . Work tool applies two stage optimization process, uses optimality gap 10% first stage focuses maximizing species’ representation minimizing cost (using budget , receptively) optimality gap 15% subsequently minimize spatial fragmentation (specified). algorithm terminates, output incumbent solution. incumbent solution best solution found meets integer (binary) restrictions variables.","code":""},{"path":"https://ncc-cnc.github.io/wheretowork/articles/wtw_optimization.html","id":"resources-for-learning-more-about-exact-algorithms","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Resources for learning more about exact algorithms","title":"Optimization","text":"provide resources learning exact algorithms. particular, Gurobi Optimization – developer Gurobi exact algorithm solver – created numerous online resources help users understand exact algorithms. resources include online guides videos. created experts mathematical optimization provide detailed explanations.
